			<dd> Minecraft's sudden revive made minecraft my favorite game to play, by a long shot. The game is 10 years old, but many people still play. The Multiplayer version, is where you can play with or against other players. The Servers consist of Survival, or KitPVP gamemodes. The Survival or Singleplayer version is where you can create your own world and try to survive. </dd>

		<li> Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow Six Seige </li>
		<dt>
			<dd> Rainbow Six Seige is a online multiplayer shooter. Instead of being a "Shoot first, then think" type of First Person Shooter. The game starts with one group being inside, with sometimes, being hostages. For the "breaching" team, the objective is to elimanate the group inside the home. The "Defend" team's job is to make elimanate the "Attacker" team and to stay alive. Based on what Operator they have unlocked or are currently using, they can set traps, or for the "Attacker" team, get them eyes on what is going on inside the home.
